The mapped 'Base Cretaceous' (Intra Valavginian) horizon was penetrated at 2343mKB, approximately 164m high to prognosis. Immediately beneath the Intra-Valanginian event, 60m of Berriasian- Tithonian aged glauconitic claystones, siltstones and argillaceous sandstones of the Upper Vulcan Formation were penetrated.

However, beneath the Intra-Kimmeridgian Unconformity 583m of Kimmeridgian-Oxfordian aged sediments of the Lower Vulcan Fm were penetrated. No hydrocarbon shows(fluorescence or significant gas)were encountered in either of the sandstone reservoirs at the base of the Oliver Fm. Up to 15% total gas,and 5-40% dull yellow green fluorescence with a slow cut was observed in the argillaceous sands of the Upper Vulcan Formation age. The lack of conventional wireline logs over this and the lower two sands made detailed log interpretation impossible. MWD log interpretation of this sand indicated the presence of a residual hydrocarbon column. Traces of fluorescence were observed in the Intra-Oxfordian aged sand of the Lower Vulcan Formation, however MWD log interpretation indicates the zone to be water bearing. MWD resistivity anomalies and minor gas in the basal Oxfordian sand suggested the presence of hydrocarbons. The second sidetrack, updip of the original Allaru well , showed no anomalies and the sands were interpreted as water bearing. The resistivity variations in the original well are interpreted to be due to increases in shaliness and porosity reduction as a result of cementation.

The sedimentary sequence encountered by the well was essentially as predicted, with the top of the Hyland Bay Formation (Top Late Permian) coming in at -2408m SS some 441m high to the prognosed depth. The Base Cretceous Unconformity came in at -1419m SS, 97m high to predicted. The only potential reservoir zones found in the well were the basal sands of the Miocene and Eocene and the uppermost section of the Cretacoeus sandstone sequence. Minor gases were detected from the Early Triassic down into the Late Permian (2290-2460). Wet gas was detected in Late Permian from 2800-2825m and at the base of the Triassic between 2414-2416m. (R.Temple 5/8/87) The presence of the argillaceous limestone with its low interpretated porosity of <5%, and virtually no background gas, indicates that this carbonate sequence has no reservoir potential in the area. The small shaly sand from 2786-2787m is far to thin to be considered as reservoir quality. The siltstone directly below this had minor wet gas readings but its low porosity (11%) means that it can not be considered to have future exploration potential. The Anderdon 1 well was a valid structural test, with minor hydrocarbon indications in the Early to Middle Triassic and the Late Permian. The geochemical results performed on samples from the formations indicate that the source rocks are gas-prone with only minor liquid generation at present. The Triassic kerogens are immature while those in the Late Permain are over-mature. Since the area has no prospective source, and the Late Permian is not reservoir prospective, the area can now be considered as lacking further exploration potential in the Late Permian.Anderdon 1 is located 40km SW of Swift 1 and 66km SW of Osprey 1 in the Bonaparte Basin.

Below 4700mRT, instead of Plover Formation sandstones as prognosed, a volcanic sequence was encountered. Some gas saturation has been interpreted through the igneous section but there is no evidence of significant reservoir potential. Sidewall cores obtained from this interval are described as dolerite and may have some secondary porosity resulting from dissolution of secondary carbonate or chlorite.

From the TOC data measured from sidewall cores in the Lower Vulcan Formation, it is apparent that the argillaceous siltstones are a potential source rock. The Rock-Eval pyrolysis data and the pyrolysis gas chromotography (PGC) analysis indicate that the Lower Vulcan Fm would generate both oil and gas at oil window maturity with the PGC analysis indicating a preference for oil. However, the sediments are not mature within this well (e.g.vitrinite reflectance of 0.43 at 2138 mKB) and would need to be encountered at greater depth to have been responsible for sourcing accumulated hydrocarbon.

Previously, no wells had been drilled in this permit and only scant regional seismic cover was available prior to the area being awarded to BHP Petroleum in 1985. The Asterias prospect was mapped as a faulted anticline formed at the junction of two faults at the Lower Cretaceous primary target horizon. Secondary targets were identified at the Maastrichtian and Early Tithonian levels. The well was drilled to a total depth of 4400 mRT (4383 mSS) through a sequence of sandstones, siltstones, claystones and carbonates which ranged in age from Recent to Upper Jurassic. Unconformities were encountered at base Miocene, base Early Campanian,Turonian and Valanginian horizons. Although no moveable hydrocarbons were encountered, minor hydrocarbon indications in the sandstones, siltstones and claystones were present from 3300 mRT to total depth. Moreover,significant residual hydrocarbons were encountered within thin sands of Tithonian age from 4306 to 4338 mRT. Water saturations were sufficiently high however, and within sands which were very thin that testing was not warranted. Asterias-1 was unsuccessful in discovering economic, producible hydrocarbons due to a combination of factors. At the Maastrichtian and Lower Cretaceous levels, the prospect appears to lack adequate structuring while at the Upper Jurassic horizon, poor top and lateral seals are probably responsible. In addition, the geochemical source potential of all the horizons sampled is particularly poor. The abundance of minor hydrocarbon shows over the Lower Cretaceous/ Upper Jurassic sequence suggests that it has been charged by richer source rocks present at some distance away from this location.

A gas column was identified from 2598-2638.5 mRKB with a gas-oil contact (GOC) at 2611.5 mTVDSS (2606 mTVDSS in Montara-1). However, the interval below 2638.5 m consists of a gradational change from a clean, well sorted sandstone to a highly bioturbated argillaceous sandstone. Cores showed 100% fluorescence from 2638.5-2649 mRKB (corrected depth). RFT pressure gradient plots could not define an oil gradient due to sample points being tight or supercharged. Extrapolated from the lower water bearing sand, an oil-water contact was intersected at 2644 mRKB (-2617 mTVDSS). This inconsistency, which also occured in Montara-1 in a similar silty section, could not provide a definitive oil water contact. Consequently, the sidetrack well (Bilyara-1ST) was projected 300 m downdip to the southeast to intersect the OWC in the clean reservoir sand section. No cores were cut in the sidetrack. Bilyara-1ST intersected the reservoir sand at 2688.5 mRKB(-2595mTVDSS) which is 24.5m downdip. Final integration of the results of Bilyara-1 and Bilyara-1ST results concluded that a 46.5m gas column (2565 - 2611.5 mSS), 3m oil column (2611.5 - 2614.5 mSS) and a residual oil column (2614.5 - 2629 mSS) were trapped in the Bilyara structure. Geochemical analysis (vitrinite reflectance) shows source rock characteristics for the Oxfordian shales are similar to those in Montara-1. The mixed source rock facies are likely to produce both oil and gas. Maturity analysis (kinetic modelling and vitrinite reflectance) suggests that the Late Oxfordian marine shale unit is generally immature within the vicinity of the Montara Arch and is interpreted to lie just above the oil window. The mature oil present is thus believed to be sourced from the mature sequences buried deeper towards the south and north of the Montara Arch.Located 2.9km west of Montara-1 and 17.4km southeast of Swift-1.","Petroleum","","1241","","35","0","0","0","0","0"

The seismic horizons/formation tops were all intersected close to prognosis, with the primary objective horizon (Callovian Unconformity) being intersected 28m low to prognosis. This is interpreted to be mainly a function of the seismic velocities utilized in the depth conversion and did not affect the structural integrity of the trap. The presence of Cretaceous sands which were not prognosed to be present at the Cartier 1 location effectively resulted in the breaching of the lateral fault seal on the northwest side of the Cartier structure. This is interpreted to have destroyed the trap integrity. Log evaluation of the primary objective Triassic sands indicates them to be low porosity, very arillaceous and water saturated.

Minor hydro- carbon indications were observed over the interval 1462 to 1527m within Triassic sediments. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was observed within sample cuttings and sidewall cores, associated with a gas anomaly (C1 to C4).It was evident from wireline logs that the sand- stones over this interval either had porosity reduced significantly by carbonate cementation and were water saturated. The hydrocarbon shows over this interval are interpreted to be attributed to minor residual hydrocarbons. The Mid-Late Triassic sediments subcropping the Base Cretaceous unconformity were younger in age than those intersected at Cassini-1 and the nearby Challis wells. This confirms the interpretation of generally westerly dipping Triassic sediments along the Cleghorn Horst. Similar to Cassini-1, the thick sandstones that occur within the Challis Formation intersected in the Challis Field were poorly developed at Cassini-2. Late diagnetic carbonate cementation has reduced porosity significantly within many of the thin sandstones. Success at Cassini-2 depended largely on the validity of the velocity model used. The velocity model proposed slow velocities within the central horst area as seen in the Challis Field. However,this model proved to be incorrect as the actual velocity to Base Cretaceous was significantly faster than predicted. Remapping of the Cassini feature shows that the structure tested at Cassini-2 is not closed and that any oil migrating through Triassic reservoirs has migrated updip to the northeast towards Cassini-1 and the Challis Field.

The reservoir section in Challis 4 consists of dolomitic sandstone, shale, dolomite and thin, porous sandstones. This indicates that the main reservoir sand (B-sand) which has a sheet-like geometry in the first 3 Challis wells has shaled out. Challis 4 intersected 1.9m of net oil sand over a 22.7m gross oil column from 1392.8 to 1415.5m RT. Log derived porosities in these fine grained porous Triassic sands average 19.9%, while the average effective water saturation is 35.1%. The OWC is estimated from pressure data to be at 1418m RT. Production testing of the interval 1390.0-1410.0m RT achieved an unstabilised flow rate from 2850 to 2418 STB/Day with 0.79 MMSCF/D gas and no water over a 14.5 hour time period on a 3/4inch choke. The oil had a gravity of 39.9 deg API. Below the OWC Challis 4 intersected two thick sands which can be correlated with the C3 and D sands. These are interpreted as sheet sands deposited by a channel system migrating across a broad estuary. Two thin isolated channel sands were intersected just below the C3 and D sand. The results of Challis 4 indicate that there are boundaries to the Sheet-like continuity of the main reservoir sand (B-sand) within the limits of the field. Whether Challis 4 is representative of the entire western end of the structure is unknown, as seismic resolution in this area is inadequate for predicting such facies variation. The cored section in Challis 4 is interpretated as consisting of several thin upward shoaling sequences with subtidal sediments at the base, tidal or mixed flats in the middle, and an exposure surface at the top. Drill stem tests in the Challis field have shown that the tide height has significant effect on formation pressure.Located 600km W of Darwin, 3.5km SW of Challis-3, 1.2km SW of Challis-1 and 2.7km SW of Challis-2A.","Petroleum","","820","12","7","0","0","12","0","0"

Average porosity was 16.3%, average hydrocarbon saturation was 79%, with a net to gross ratio (N:G) of 90%. The well flowed 60 deg API oil at a stablised rate of approximately 7 700 BOPD with 0.37 MMcfpd gas. The separator gas oil ratio (GOR) was recorded as 50 scf/stb, however subsequent laboratory results suggest that the real GOR is 239 scf/stb. The oil water contact (OWC) remains uncertain. This gross oil column was thinner than expected. Reasons for this may include: trap not at full-to-spill point, Top Reservoir Map incorrect with no closure below the OWC, or lack of closure. Overall, the reservoir quality was better than predicted. Core porosity and permeabilty are 15.7% and 597md respectively while average log porosities are 15.2% for the Laminaria Fm and 14.8% for the Plover Fm.

Due to the optimistic southerly location of Jabiru 9, the well intersected the Base Cretaceous unconformity on the downthrown side of the major southern bounding fault. As a result, the section immediately below the unconformity consisted of a younger Oxfordian section than that encountered within the Jabiru Oil Field Limits.

The conclusion is that the oil is immobile and residual. The low oil saturation suggests an oil accumulation existed within the Keppler structure, but Late Miocene tectonics events resulted in breaching of the fault planes allowing remigration of hydrocarbons to occur.

The LWD resistivity log clearly showed thesandstone beds to be water bearing. The middle, thinner sandstone sequence, (31m gross, 19 percent net/gross), had high resistivities. However, from the lack of shows, lack of separation in the resistivity curves and slow drilling, it was concluded that they were tight and water bearing. The lower massive sandstone unit has a gross thickness of56m and a net/gross of 52 percent. Again, LWD log data and ROP indicated this unit to bewater bearing.The upper sandstone package is considered to be younger than those seen in Taltarni-1, (main control well), possibly an equivalent of WST 47. The thin tightsandstones are considered to correlate with the WST 37 package as encountered in Taltarni-1, with the deeper beds probably being a lateral equivalent of the WST 27 package.If the above correlations are correct, it indicates that the Montara Formation sandstone packages, represent a low-stand sandstone package which is correlatable throughout the sub-basin. However, the quality and thicknesses vary laterally, as would be expected.The secondary objective, Plover Formation, was encountered at 3020mRT, 120m high to prognosis. The LWD resistivity log indicates these sandstone units are relatively tight and water bearing. Limited biostratigraphic data suggest the section to be of early Jurassic age (C.torosa zone) indicating significant erosion at the Callovian Unconformity. It is considered that the absence of hydrocarbons in the well could be explained by one of two reasons;Case 1: limited generation and competition from intervening structures prevented acharge from reaching the structure.Case 2: the seal on the northeast flank has been breached by faulting, resulting insand against sand juxtaposition. Fluid inclusion studies indicate gas migration through the structure with no evidence of oil, supporting Case 1.The fact that the seismic markers came in consistently high could be due to a lateral velocity change between Taltarni-1 and Magnolia-1 and/or minor mispicks of the seismic markers. Further studies are required to resolve this problem. However,Magnolia-1 provides an excellent control point for calibration of seismic velocities.The well was plugged and abandoned as a dry well (total depth of 3109mRT) in the Plover Formation.

PVT work on the bottom hole sample taken at 3409.5mKB confirmed that the fluid within this sand is a retrograde gas-condensate Log analysis shows that the condensate bearing sand occurs within an interbedded sequence in which all other sandy intervals are water saturated. This suggests that the condensate is probably an isolated pocket which has been trapped stratigraphically.Maret 1 is located 15km SW of Montara 1.

Although a gas-oil contact is defined at 2606 mSS, a conclusive oil water contact could not be defined. An appraisal well is required to evaluate the potential field size and spill point. Montara-1 encountered a thick Oxfordian section, not previously penetrated in the Timor Sea. Five main depositional cycles comprise this 757m thick package. The clastic facies, deposited in Cycles 1-4, is now the type section of the Montara Formation. The main reservoir sand unit, 35m thick, is interpreted to be a winnowed upper shore face barrier bar or strandline sand unit, with quite extensive lateral distribution. Westward extent has been confirmed by Bilyara 1 (3km W). The oil recovered from the DST and RFT in Montara-1 is quite different to the Jabiru and Challis crude. The oil is quite waxy, suggesting terrestrial influence, and has an API gravity of 35.5. Geochemical analysis identified the Late Oxfordian marine shale unit (Cycle 5) as the major source rock interval. However, that interval in Montara 1 is slightly immature. The most probable source of the oil is therefore linked to the source kitchen to the south where terrigenous sediment influx is also evident. Geochemical analysis of the oil from the thin glauconitic Turonian sand, suggests a light mature oil, lighter than that recovered from the Oxfordian sands. Both oils are linked to the same Oxfordian source, indicating the viability of oil migrating updip to younger sequences. No reservoirs are expected in the Early Cretaceous sequences. The Turonian sand of poor porosity and permeability is interpreted to be a localised distal turbiditic unit. The possible development of marine fan units with coarser clastics is restricted to areas adjacent to the eastern scarp and in southern areas of AC/P7.The well was located on Line HA1-137, SP 595; 19km southeast of Swift-1 and 29km west of Anderdon-1.","Petroleum","","1967","172","55","125","0","0","47","0"

These results extend the length of the known oil/water contact down by 6m and increase the known oil column from 9m (at Montara 1) to 15m.

The absence of hydrocarbons suggests the timing of this breach may have preceeded the formation of the Norquay structure or that the faults on on the E side of the Keppler structure were breaching agents, rather than those of the W side. Wireline log analysis indicates both the Prion and Grebe Formations have good porosities. Those for the Prion average 27% in the upper section and 18% in the lower.

Lack of a substantial oil reservoir could be explained by a breach in the Plover Fm seal (logging revealed water saturation in the 3193 - 3263m interval).

During the drilling of the well, 5 to 15% of the cuttings from the upper part of the objective, 3340 to 3415 mRT, gave a dull yellow pinpoint to spotty direct sample fluorescence, whilst sidewall cores between 3334 to 3458 mRT gave a patchy yellow to bluish white fluorescence. These data suggest that hydrocarbons migrated through the structure but, at best, only a minimal accumulation occurred, prior to leakage via crestal faults. In the pre-drill evaluation, structural (trap) integrity was recognised as a key risk (the other being adequate charge), but the Pandorina prospect was considered to have the least chance of fault leakage of the remaining prospects in the Permit. Given the negative results of the well, the risk of leakage for similar style traps in the area needs to be re-evaluated.

The well intersected a 627m thick diapiric evaporate sequence, which confirmed the interpretation that salt diapirism and pillowing had resulted in the development of structural closure at both the Intra-Valanginian and Intra-Kimmeridgian Unconformity levels. The well identified the presence of a deep previously unidentified claystone filled graben. The 1637m of Upper and Lower Vulcan Formation claystone penetrated in this well are the typical Type 2 source rocks, with an average expulsion efficiency of 45% in the Lower Vulcan Formation. Oil generation commenced with in the graben in the Early Cretacaous and currently the rich Lower Vulcan Formation lies within the oil window. This finding greatly enhances the prospectivity of the area. Two thin sands were intersected within the Upper Vulcan Formation. Although the sands did not contain significant volumes of oil, submarine fan sands remain highly prospective as the formation is laterally continuous over much of the region. The presence of these two sands proves the existence of submarine fan sands in the area, and thus the potential for separate thicker sands to be developed locally or for the two sands intersected to thicken up away from Paqualin 1.Located 19.5km SE of Rainbow 1.","Petroleum","","112","169","46","132","0","0","37","0"

RFT's suggest that the OWC lies between 2338 - 2341m. Evaluation of this data indicates that the OWC in most likely between 2341 - 2342m. Skua 2 intersected two potential hydrocarbon bearing zones. The first in the Late Maastrichtian (Upper Cretaceous) between 1853 - 1859m. The second in the Late Santonian (Basal Cretaceous) - Early Jurassic between 2333 - 2342m. Wireline logs, RFT's, Production tests and core analysis indicate that the Late Maastrichtian sandstone interval is water bearing with only residual oil present.

It is interesting to note that no other wells in AC/P2 had penetrated a Late Santonian sandstone prior to the drilling of Skua 2. This sandstone unit (2332 - 2338m) contained significant quantities of nodular pyrite. The operator concludes that production test data indicate that the Santonian and Jurassic sands within the oil column are of reasonable reservoir quality. Although the flow rate of 450 STB/day is not commercially producible,further evaluation is required to determine whether these reservoirs are commercially producible elsewhere on the structure. The well also established the presence of residual oil in highly porous and permeable Late Maastrichtian sands.

Immediately beneath the 'Base Cretaceous' event, 13m of early Cretaceous clastics were encountered. These sandstones were expected to be absent across the Snowmass horst. The unconformity between the Triassic and Cretaceous sections represents the expression of the Callovian unconformity in this region of AC/P4. No hydrocarbon shows were encountered in the basal Eocene, Early Cretaceous or Late Triassic sandstone reservoirs. Minor fluorescence was observed in sidewall cores from the basal Paleocene between 777 to 787m. Log analysis of this interval indicated hydrocarbon saturations of up to 30% with effective porosities ranging from 20 - 29%. Subsequent cased-hole RFT's and a single DST (777.5 - 787.6M) across this interval failed to recover or produce any formation fluids due to extremely low permeabilities. Late Miocene-Recent faulting has considerably modified the pre-existing structural geometry at the objective 'Base Cretaceous' level, and breached the regionally extensive base regional seal. The most likely explanation as to why Snowmass 1 was dry is due to a combination of the effects of Late Miocene tectonism breaching the base regional Cretaceous seal and its subsequent control on migration pathways.Snowmass 1 is located approx 22km NE of the Challis oil field, 30km SW of Turnstone 1 and 18km NW of Ibis 1.

Top Cretaceous was 79m high to prognosis due to the main southern bounding fault being intersected at 795m, within Paleocene limestones. This fault was associated with 120m of lost section. The low gamma interval at 1325-1330m, within the Cretaceous, consists of chert and claystone. This unit correlates with radiolarite in the northern part of the AC/P4 permit, which appears to act as a 'thief' zone. In the Tancred area this interval appears to be tight and is not a potential seal problem. U Triassic sediments immediately below the Callovian unconformity illustrate the Tancred structure was high in the U Jurassic-Lw Cretacoeus, relative to the Turnstone. The timing of this uplift and erosion is interpreted to be Kimmeridgian and to have had a large influence along the Jabiru-Turnstone horst. Tancred 1 was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole.Tancred 1 is located 3km E of Turnstone-1 and 44km of the Jabiru oilfield.

This hole section was terminated at 3256 mMDRT after a regressionto near hydrostatic levels had been observed in the pore pressure just above theElm Sandstone reservoir. One wireline logging run was attempted, prior to settingthe 244 mm (95/8in) casing at 3246 mMDRT, but after two attempts this was abortedwhen the logging tools could not pass below an obstacle at 2003 mMDRT.The 216 mm (8in) hole section was drilled just into the top of the Elm Sandstonereservoir before core point was called at 3315 mMDRT. The reservoir core was thencut from 3315 to 3343 mMDRT, and this was later found to contain predominantlyclaystone lithology. Drilling then proceeded without problem in the 216 mm (8in)hole section through silty claystone, claystone and shale of the Late Jurassic LowerVulcan Formation before being terminated at 3525 mMDRT. A final wire-line loggingsuite comprising six runs was conducted. The Elm Sandstone intersected in Vesta-2 is a complex reservoir with the maingood quality sandstone thinner than expected.

The well was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole after the drilling assembly became stuck at 2934mKB. Following a succesful back-off at 2900mKB the well was logged and cemented. Yarra 1 penetrated a stratigraphic sequence basically as prognosed with the main objective level 33m deep to prediction. The pre-drill maps adequately define the feature and the well is therefore thought to have tested a valid closed structure. Cretaceous calcilutites and marls form an adequeate seal for the Triassic sandstones beneath the Mid Valanginian Unconformity. Gas readings remained low throughout the entire drilled section and no significant hydrocarbon indications were observed in the reservoir sections.Located 25km NW of Swan 1. 13km S of Rainbow 1.
